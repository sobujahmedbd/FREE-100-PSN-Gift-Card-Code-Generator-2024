Avoid Scams: If a website or app promises free PSN codes in exchange for personal details or payment, it‚Äôs likely a scam.
Use Verified Sources: Always ensure the platforms you use are legitimate and have positive reviews.
Protect Your Account: Never share your PSN account credentials or click on suspicious links.
